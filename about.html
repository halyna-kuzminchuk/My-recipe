             <p>Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn't go away in 2001. In 2003, Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents' cooking on What's for dinner. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/europe">(Here's more of that story.)</a> Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, What's for Dinner? was acquired by Dotdash Meredith, a New York-based media company.</p>
